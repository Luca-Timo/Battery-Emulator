## What is Battery Emulator?

Many manufacturers sell home battery systems to enable homeowners to store power collected from the grid, or renewable sources, to use at times when electricity demand is higher. However almost all of these home battery systems charge a high cost for every kilowatt hour (kWh) of capacity you buy.

At the same time, EV manufacturers have been putting high capacity battery packs into their cars, with no firm plan for what should happen to those batteries if the car is damaged in a crash, or reaches the end of its life as a vehicle.

**Battery Emulator** enables EV battery packs to be repurposed for stationary storage. It acts as a translation layer between the EV battery and the home inverter. This makes it extremely cheap and easy to use large EV batteries in a true plug'n'play fashion!

> [!CAUTION]
> Working with high voltage is dangerous. Always follow local laws and regulations regarding high voltage work. If you are unsure about the rules in your country, consult a licensed electrician for more information.


## Quickstart guide üìú
- Pick a [supported inverter](https://github.com/dalathegreat/Battery-Emulator/wiki#supported-inverters-list) (solar panels optional) :sun_with_face: 
- Pick a [supported battery](https://github.com/dalathegreat/Battery-Emulator/wiki#supported-batteries-list) :battery: 
- Order the Battery-Emulator [compatible hardware](https://github.com/dalathegreat/Battery-Emulator/wiki#where-do-i-get-the-hardware-needed) :robot: 
- Follow the [installation guidelines](https://github.com/dalathegreat/Battery-Emulator/wiki/Installation-guidelines) section for how to install and commission your battery properly :notebook: 

## Installation basics ü™õ
1. Connect your Battery Emulator hardware to your EV battery
2. Connect your Battery Emulator hardware to your inverter
3. Wire up high voltage cable between the inverter and the battery
4. Add a low voltage power supply to your Battery Emulator hardware
5. Configure any additional requirements to allow Battery Emulator to switch on your EV battery (also referred to as 'closing contactors')
6. Enjoy a big cheap grid connected battery!

For examples showing wiring, see each battery type's own Wiki page. For instance the [Nissan LEAF page](https://github.com/dalathegreat/Battery-Emulator/wiki/Battery:-Nissan-LEAF---e%E2%80%90NV200)

## How to install the software üíª

Start by watching this [quickstart guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR3t7j0R9Z0)
